<p class = "lead">For the longest time, I never understood why my professors insisted that I have a section for quotes; a waste of time (I thought).</br></br> 
Over time I have found myself using quotes to better express an idea or a feeling; To motivate/inspire me (or, even better, someone else).
</br></br> 
I hope you will find this collection of quotes useful.

<em>"The random passers-by, each living a life as vivid and complex as your own. They carry on invisibly around you, wearing the accumulated weight of their own ambitions, friends, routines, mistakes, worries, triumphs and inherited craziness. When your life moves on to the next scene, there’s flickers in place, wrapped in a cloud of backstories, inside jokes, characters struggling together with countless other stories you’ll never be able to see. That you never know it exists. In which you might appear only once. As an extra sipping coffee in the background. As a blur of traffic passing on the highway. As a lighted window at dusk."</em></br> <strong>- John Koenig</strong>
<br /><br />

<em>"Desire is the key to motivation, but it's determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek."</em></br> <strong>- Mario Andretti</strong>
<br /><br />

<em>"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."</em>
</br> <strong>- H. P. Lovecraft</strong>
